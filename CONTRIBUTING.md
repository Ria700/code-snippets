# Contributing Guidelines


To contribute to this repository and add  code snippets, the following pointers should be kept in mind to avoid merge conflicts and other problems such as a bad PR while contributing:

- Create a markdown file with a suitable name according to your snippet. Make sure the code snippet is not already in the codebase and is in the correct sub-directory.


- Add the snippet and output in the appropriate block. For example, for a python snippet:
    ~~~
    ```java
    print("code snippet here")
    ```
    ~~~
4. You can add a **Description** sub-heading if you want to provide an explanation! 
5. Add a **Contributed By** sub-heading at the end of the file and add your name and GitHub username  in a tabular format in the markdown file.

## Do not add pure code files, add your snippets in the cod eblocks in the markdown file.
